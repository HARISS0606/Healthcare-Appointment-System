🏥 Healthcare Appointment System

A simple, user-friendly appointment management system built using Python concepts and basic web technologies.

📌 Project Overview

The Healthcare Appointment System is designed to simplify the process of booking and managing appointments in a healthcare environment.
This mini-project was developed during my internship at IPCS Global – Madurai, using Python logic along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the interface.

The system enables users to:

Book new appointments

View all appointments in a structured table

Search appointments by patient or doctor

Edit appointment details

Cancel appointments easily

🎯 Objective
